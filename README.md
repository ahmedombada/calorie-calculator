# calorie-calculator

this is my attempt in creating a DJANGO web app, this is not a finished product by any means, its still very much a working progress.


available functionality:
1. users can write notes about the day.
2. users can add food to the database and can enter calorie information.
3. users can create a meal from all the available ingredients stored in the food database.

functionalities to be added:
1. users should be able to create a meal and save it with its over all calories

this is considered done when users basically have a self hosted nutrition diary/calculator. 

P.S:
im an infrastructure engineer and not a software developer, so, excuse my dirty code :D.
